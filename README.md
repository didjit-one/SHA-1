# SHA-1
The program implements a practical task: "Implementation of a Hashing Algorithm"
This project implements a custom hashing algorithm in Rust. The algorithm used is SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1). It takes an input message and produces a 160-bit hash value known as a message digest.

Here is an example of the program output:

```
SHA-1 hash (SHA-1): c571b86549e49bf223cf648388c46288c2241b5a
--------------------------------------------------
Message: SHA-1
Expected hash: c571b86549e49bf223cf648388c46288c2241b5a
Computed hash: c571b86549e49bf223cf648388c46288c2241b5a
Test passed: true
--------------------------------------------------
Message: In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a hash function
Expected hash: 5106fcd6b2f5b09cc7e6b2d76a93578d74ef4755
Computed hash: 5106fcd6b2f5b09cc7e6b2d76a93578d74ef4755
Test passed: true
--------------------------------------------------
Message: In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest â€“ typically rendered as 40 hexadecimal digits. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.The algorithm has been cryptographically broken but is still widely used.
Expected hash: e85bf139b96daa8af5ef79d8825a57fe39335016
Computed hash: e85bf139b96daa8af5ef79d8825a57fe39335016
Test passed: true
--------------------------------------------------
My implementation: 0.000015 seconds
Library implementation: 0.000018 seconds
Performance difference (my program -  lib program): -0.000003 seconds

## Instructions

To use the hashing algorithm in your Rust project, follow these steps:

1. Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
 sha1 = "0.10.5" 
 
 hex = "0.4.3"

## Code Explanation

- `my_sha1_hash`: Implements the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, calculating the hash of the input message and returning it as a hexadecimal string.
- `test_single_block()`: Tests the `my_sha1_hash` function with a single block message and verifies the computed hash against an expected hash.
- `test_multiple_blocks()`: Tests the `my_sha1_hash` function with a multi-block message and verifies the computed hash against an expected hash.
- `test_multiple_chunks()`: Tests the `my_sha1_hash` function with a message that requires multiple chunks for hashing and verifies the computed hash against an expected hash.
- `test_performance()`: Measures the performance of the `my_sha1_hash` function compared to a library implementation of SHA-1, providing insights into the execution time difference.
